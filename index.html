          <ul id="timeline-list">
            <li><strong>17th Rabī‘ al-Awwal,
            1st Year of ‘Ãmul Fil (570 AD)</strong> - The tine at which the Prophet was born.</li>
            <li><strong>At the age of forty</strong> - Muhammad(God’s blessings and peace be upon him) received the revelation from God through Arch-Angel Gabriel.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret Propagation</strong> - The first time that the Prophet invited people to accept the message of Islam, he faced a distressing and
            painful reaction. Out of necessity he was forced henceforth to propagate his message secretly for three
            years until he was ordered again by God to invite his very close relatives to accept the message.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Propagation</strong> - After this period, according to Divine instructions, the Prophet began to propagate his mission openly.
            With the beginning of open propagation the people of Mecca reacted most severely because the Islamic
            message —of worshipping One God and of equality among the believers without any distinction of race,
            colour or wealth— fared completely against the status quo. Most painful afflictions and tortures were
            inflicted upon the Prophet and the new converts.</li>
            <li><strong>10th year of his prophecy</strong> - the idol-worshippers of Mecca devised a secret plan to kill the Prophet. At night they surrounded
            his house with the intent of forcing themselves in the house at the end of the night and cutting him to
            pieces while he was in bed. But Almighty God informed him of the plan and commanded him to leave for
            Yathrib. The Prophet asked ‘Alí to sleep in his bed so that the enemy would not detect his absence; ‘Alí
            readily agreed to sacrifice his life for the Prophet and slept in the Prophet’s bed. Then the Prophet left
            the house under Divine protection, passing amidst his enemies, and taking refuge in a cave near Mecca.
            After three days his enemies, having looked everywhere, gave up hope of capturing him returned to
            Mecca. The Prophet left the cave and set out for Yathrib.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Establishing the right community</strong> - The people of Yathrib, whose leaders had already accepted the message of the Prophet and sworn
            allegiance to him, welcomed him with open arms and placed their lives and property at his disposal. In
            Yathrib, for the first time, the Prophet formed a small Islamic community and signed treaties with the
            Jewish tribes in and around the city as well as with the powerful Arab tribes of the region. He undertook
            the task of propagating the Islamic message and Yathrib became famous as “Madīnatu ‘r-Rasūl” (the
            City of the Prophet). Later on, it became famous as “Medina”
            </li>
            <li><strong>Encounters on the Battlefields</strong> - Islam was advancing rapidly but at the same time the idol-worshippers of Mecca, as well as the Jewish
            tribes of Arabia, were unrestrained in their harassment of Muslims. With the help of the hypocrites of
            Medina who were among the community of Muslims, they created new misfortunes for the Muslims
            every day until finally the matter led to war.
            Many battles took place between the Muslims, the Arab polytheists and the Jews. The Muslims were
            victorious in most of those battles. Great battles happend like <span class="indent-list">The battle of Badr(2nd year of the migration), The Battle of Uhud( 3rd year after hijra), The battle of Khandaq(5th year of the hijra), The Bani Qurazah(5th year of the hijra), The Bani Mustalaq War(6th sixth year of the hijra), The Battle of Khaybar(7th year of the hijra</span></li>
            <li><strong>The Treaty of Hudaybia & The Fall of Mecca</strong> - As a result of the activity of the Prophet and the selfless effort of the Muslims during that period, Islam
            spread through the Arabian Peninsula. There were also letters written to kings of other countries such as
            Persia, Byzantine and Abyssinia inviting them to accept Islam.
            During this time the Prophet lived in poverty and was proud of it. He never spent a moment of his life in
            vain. Rather, his time was divided into three segments: one for God, in worshipping and remembering
            Him; a segment for himself and his household and domestic needs; and a segment for the people.
            During this part of his time he was engaged in spreading and teaching Islam and its sciences,
            administrating to the needs of the Islamic society, removing whatever evils that existed, providing for the
            needs of the Muslims, strengthening domestic and foreign bonds, and other similar matters.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Last Pilgrimage & Death</strong> - In the tenth year of the hijra, the Prophet decided to go for hajj (pilgrimage). He invited Muslims to join
            him and be acquainted with the hajj rituals. Over a hundred thousand Muslims joined him in the hajj.
            Although this was the first and the last hajj of the Prophet, it is known as “al-Hajjãtu ‘l-widâ’ — the Last
            Pilgrimage.” He seized the opportunity of the unprecedented gathering to remind the Muslims of many
            important values of Islam.
            On the way back to Medina, he stopped at Ghadir Khumm and delivered a lengthy sermon in which he
            summarized the major teachings of Islam, informed the Muslims of his approaching death and appointed
            ‘Alí bin Abi Tãlib as his successor.
            After ten years of stay in Medina, the Prophet fell ill and died after a few days of illness. According to
            existing traditions, the last words on his lips were advice concerning slaves and women.

          <p id="quote"><em>“O King! We were plunged in the depth of ignorance and barbarism; we worshipped idols, we lived an
          unchaste life, we ate dead bodies and we spoke abominations; we disregarded every feeling of humanity
          and the duties of hospitality and neighbourhood; we knew no law, but of the strong — when God raised
          among us a man, of whose noble birth, truthfulness, honesty and purity we are aware; and he called us
          to the Unity of God and taught us not to associate anything with Him; he forbade us the worship of idols;
          and enjoined on us to speak the truth, to be faithful to our trusts, to be merciful and to regard the rights
          of neighbours; he forbade us to speak evil of women or to eat the sustenance of orphans; he ordered us
          to fly from vice and to abstain from evil; to offer prayers, to render alms, to observe the fast.
          We have believed in him, we have accepted his teachings and his injunction to worship God and not
          associate anything with Him.
          For this reason our people have risen against us, have persecuted us in order to make us forgo the
          worship of God and return to the worship of idols of stone and wood and other abominations. They
          tortured and injured us, until finding no safety among them; we have come to your country and hope you
          will protect us from their oppression.”
